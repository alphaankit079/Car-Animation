# 🚗 Car Animation Web Page

A visually engaging animated car simulation built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project mimics a moving car on a dynamic road, featuring rotating wheels, a moving background, and background audio for an immersive experience.

## 🌟 Features

- 🚘 **Animated Car** with continuously rotating wheels  
- 🌳 **Moving Background** simulating a driving environment  
- 🌀 Smooth CSS animations (shake, scroll, rotation)  
- 🔊 **Background Sound** added using JavaScript (`sound.mp3`)  
- 🎯 Fully responsive structure and lightweight  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Markup structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling and animations (keyframes, transforms)  
- **JavaScript** – Adds background sound and sets up the DOM  

## 🎨 Animation Highlights

- `wheelRotation` – Rotates the wheels infinitely  
- `carMove` – Scrolls the road (track) to simulate movement  
- `carShake` – Adds bounce to the car for realism  
- `bodyShake` – Slight up-down page motion for extra effect
